# TODO

Deferred items for future implementation:

- Task loop launcher (`launcher.sh`) that reads `dev-tasks.json` and loops Claude through tasks
- `CLAUDE.md` with workflow instructions (implement → test → rebase → merge+push → log)
- `data/dev-tasks.json` task list format
- `PROGRESS.md` experience log
- Git worktree isolation per task
- Conflict resolution and retry logic
- Auto-merge to main with push
