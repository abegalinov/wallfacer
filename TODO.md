# TODO

Deferred items for future implementation:

- Git worktree isolation per task (instead of shared workspace mounts)
- Conflict resolution and retry logic for concurrent workspace edits
- Test suite for Go server (handler, runner, store)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI (`go mod audit` or similar)
